CSC231 HW 8

Creates four functions as follows:

  1. Receives address of string as well as its length, changes the string's characters in place from lowercase letters to uppercase
  
  2. Receives three 32-bit integers and computes `4*(a + b) + 3*c`, returning the result in `eax`
  
  3. Receives address of array as well as its length, returns in `eax` the number of negative numbers in the array
  
  4. Receives three 32-bit integers and returns the smallest of the three in `eax`
